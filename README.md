# uhppoted

`uhppoted` implements a set of cross-platform building blocks for access control systems based on the 
*UHPPOTE UT0311-L0x* TCP/IP Wiegand access control boards. Currently available:

- device API
- external application API
- CLI for scripting and system administration
- REST service for integration with HTTP servers and mobile clients
- MQTT endpoint for integration with IOT systems
- AWS S3 integration for file managed access control lists
- Google Sheets integration for spreadsheet managed access control lists
- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) low code environment integration

Supported operating systems:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
- ARM7 _(e.g. RaspberryPi)_

This project is a fork of the original [Go CLI](https://github.com/twystd/uhppote-go) project which had outgrown
its initial scope and was relocated to [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted) to simplify future development.

### Compatible Hardware

As per this issue [[Question] Compatible Hardware](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-core/issues/1), **UHPPOTE** appears to be a specific 
branding (or distributor) for the access control boards manufactured by [Shenzhen Wiegand Industrial Co., Ltd](http://www.wiegand.com.cn/english).

The software in this repository has been tested and is known to work with these specific boards:

| AliExpress | [TCP/IP RFID ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM Wiegand 26](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000781912427.html) |

#### Firmware versions

| Version | Notes |
| ------- | ---- |
| 6.56    | Minimum firmware version (cf. [carbonsphere/UHPPOTE](https://github.com/carbonsphere/UHPPOTE) |
| 6.62    | Lowest firmware version in use |
| 8.92    | Latest tested firmware version |

_Notes:_

1. Firmware v6.62 sends anomalous _listen events_ with `0x19` as the start of message identifier. This appears to have
been fixed in later firmware versions but patches to support these events are included in:

- [`uhppote-core`](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-core/blob/75a185a48184ecb68a07a09ebdd9ea1a8f96ba2c/encoding/UTO311-L0x/UT0311-L0x.go#L201-L204)
- [`uhppote-simulator`](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-simulator/blob/f599512fb821c892a75786bbe4f35f6ebb4563d9/commands/run.go#L125-L134)
- [`node-red-contrib-uhppoted`](https://github.com/uhppoted/node-red-contrib-uhppoted/blob/74de32d62bee8097c03c9a1abc2bb45b0160f7b2/nodes/codec.js#L93-L100)

## Raison d'Ãªtre

The components supplement the manufacturer supplied application which is 'Windows-only' and provides limited support 
for integration with other systems. 

The components are intended to simplify the integration of access control into systems based on:
- standard REST architectecture
- [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot)
- [Google Cloud IoT](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot)
- [IBM Watson IoT Platform](https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com)
- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) low code environment integration
