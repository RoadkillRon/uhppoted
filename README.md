# uhppoted

`uhppoted` implements a set of cross-platform building blocks for access control systems based on the 
*UHPPOTE UT0311-L0x* TCP/IP Wiegand access control boards. Currently available:

- device API
- external application API
- CLI for scripting and system administration
- REST service for integration with HTTP servers and mobile clients
- MQTT endpoint for integration with IOT systems

Supported operating systems:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

This project is a fork of the original [Go CLI](https://github.com/twystd/uhppote-go) project which had outgrown
its initial scope and was relocated to [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted) to simplify future development.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

The components supplement the manufacturer supplied application which is 'Windows-only' and provides limited support 
for integration with other systems. 

The components are intended to simplify the integration of access control into systems based on:
- standard REST architectecture
- [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot)
- [Google Cloud IoT](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot)
- [IBM Watson IoT Platform](https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com)

## Releases

- v0.6.2: Added access control list commands to `uhppoted-rest`
- v0.6.1: Added access control list commands to `uhppote-cli`
- v0.6.0: `uhppoted-acl-s3` module
- v0.5.1: Initial release following restructuring into standalone Go *modules* and *git submodules*
- v0.5.0: Add MQTT endpoint for remote access to UT0311-L0x controllers
- v0.4.2: Reworked `GetDevice` REST API to use directed broadcast and added get-device to CLI
- v0.4.1: Get/set door control state functionality added to simulator, CLI and REST API
- v0.4.0: REST API service
- v0.3.1: Functional simulator with minimal command API
- v0.2.0: Load access control list from TSV file
- v0.1.0: Bare-bones but functional CLI

## Installation

Binaries for Linux, Windows, MacOS and Raspbian/ARM7 are distributed in the tarball for each release. To install
the binaries, download and extract the tarball to a directory of your choice.

### Building from source

*uhppoted* is the parent project for the individual components which are referenced as git submodules -
to clone the entire source tree:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted.git

```

The supplied `Makefile` has targets to build binaries for all the supported operating systems:
```
make build
```
or 
```
make release
```

To pull upstream changes for all submodules:

```
git submodule update --remote
```
